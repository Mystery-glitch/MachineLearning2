# Malaria Detection
In this project our aim is to identify whether a cell is infected or uninfected. 

# Dataset
<img src="D:\Machine Learning Project2\images\image.png">
The dataset contains 27,558 cell images, where we got 13779 images of infected cell and remaining 13779 images of uninfected cell. Images that are present in the dataset are of the **Red Blood Cells**.<br>
Hear's a breakdown:<br>
- The **uninfected cells** look uniform, smooth and mostly of single color (like purple).
- The **infected cells** show some purple spots or ring like structures. These are the plasmodium parasite inside the red blood cells.

**Note**: Plasmodim is a tiny organism that live in humans and mosquitoes. It is not a bacteria or virus, but a single-celled parasite.
